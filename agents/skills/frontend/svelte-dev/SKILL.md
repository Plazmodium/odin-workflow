# Svelte Development Assistance

## Instructions
1. **Evaluate the task**: Check for component building, state management, or animation needs.
2. **Utilize Svelte's strengths**: Highlight compile-time optimizations and simple syntax.
3. **Provide responses**:
   - Code: Output .svelte files with reactive statements and bindings.
   - Debugging: Explain common errors like undefined variables or store subscriptions.
   - Advanced: Cover SvelteKit for routing and server-side features.
4. **Leverage tools**: Use code_execution to run Svelte-compatible JS code.
5. **Keep explanations simple**: Use everyday analogies and reference Svelte tutorials.

## Best Practices
- Use writable stores for global state.
- Minimize external dependencies.
- Optimize with preload and lazy loading.
